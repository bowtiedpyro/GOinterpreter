# Pyros Interpreter

This repository contains an interpreter for the Pyro programming language, developed as part of a tutorial on building interpreters in Go. The project is structured to include key components of an interpreter, such as a lexer, parser, and evaluator.

## Project Structure

- **Lexer**: The lexer is responsible for tokenizing the input source code. It reads the input string and converts it into a series of tokens that the parser can understand.

- **Parser**: (To be implemented) The parser will take the tokens produced by the lexer and construct an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that represents the structure of the source code.

- **Evaluator**: (To be implemented) The evaluator will traverse the AST and execute the code, producing the desired output.

- **REPL**: The Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) allows for interactive execution of Pyros code. It reads user input, evaluates it, and prints the result.
